# React Components and Advanced State Management

## Overview  
This project demonstrates advanced React concepts, including functional components, hooks, state management using Redux, and responsive design. The application is a task management tool with user authentication and a range of features to enhance user experience and functionality.

---

## Features  

### **1. React Components and State Management**  
- **TaskInput Component:** Enables users to input new tasks.  
- **TaskList Component:** Displays the list of tasks dynamically.  
- Utilizes React hooks such as `useState` and `useEffect` for state and lifecycle management.  
- Handles asynchronous actions using **Redux Thunk** or **Redux Saga** for API calls or side effects.

---

### **2. Responsive Design**  
- Fully responsive across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.  
- Implements a **mobile-first design** approach.  
- Utilizes **CSS Grid** and **Flexbox** for layout responsiveness and alignment.  

---

### **3. Core Functionality**  
- **Add Task:**  
  - Input tasks into a text field and add them by clicking a button or pressing Enter.  
- **View Tasks:**  
  - Displays tasks in a visually organized list.  
- **Delete Task:**  
  - Allows users to delete tasks individually using a delete button.  
- **Task Prioritization:**  
  - Users can assign task priorities (e.g., High, Medium, Low), and tasks are displayed accordingly.  
- **Persistent Storage:**  
  - Data (tasks and authentication status) is stored in **localStorage** or **sessionStorage**, ensuring persistence across browser sessions.  

---

### **4. User Authentication**  
- Simulates login/logout functionality using Redux for state management.  
- Mock authentication process (no backend integration required).  
- Protects task management features behind authentication. Only logged-in users can view and manage tasks.  

---

## Additional Instructions  

- **Best Practices:**  
  - Follow best practices for organizing project structure to ensure scalability and maintainability.  
  - Write clean, modular, and reusable code.  
- **Scalability:**  
  - Design the application to accommodate future feature additions or changes seamlessly.

   ```

---

## Tools and Technologies  
- **Frontend:** React.js with functional components  
- **State Management:** Redux with Thunk/Saga for middleware  
- **Styling:** CSS Grid, Flexbox, and mobile-first design  
- **Storage:** LocalStorage/SessionStorage for persistence  

---

## Future Enhancements  
- Integration with a backend for real authentication and data storage.  
- Add due dates, notifications, or reminders for tasks.  
- Enable task categorization and search/filter features.
